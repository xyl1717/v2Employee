# Employee Directory v2

The organization is pleased with your work in creating the proof-of-concept employee-management API. Take your work to the next level by adding middleware and organizing your endpoints into routers!

## Instructions

This repository contains the solution code to the previous workshop. You will be refactoring this existing code to meet the following requirements:

- 404 and error-handling middleware exist
- All `/employees` routes are organized into a separate router
- `POST /employees` will add a new employee with the provided name, if correctly provided
  - The new employee's ID should be unique
  - Send 400 if name is not correctly provided
  - Update `employees.http` to test this endpoint

Feel free to make new folders and files as you see fit!
